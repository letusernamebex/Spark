•Potential Interview Questions:
1. What is JSON data and how to read it in Spark?
2. What if I have 3 keys in all line and 4 key in one line?
3. What is multiline and line-delimited JSON?
4. Which one works faster - multiline or line-delimited? -> line-delimited
5. How to convert nested JSON into Spark dataframe? ----important
6. What will happen if I have corrupted JSON file or invalid JSON file? -> In case of corrupted record, Spark will create a column "_corrupt_record" and show that corrupted record and in case of invalid JSON it throws error

-------------JSON----------------
• JavaScript Object Notation -> Looks like JS object
• Key-Value pair data
• Eg,: { "id":1,"name":"Manish","age":26},
       { "id":2,"name":"Vikash","age":21}
• Flexible as it is semi-structured
• Spark performs better on LINE DELIMITED JSON -> important
• We have to enable MULTI LINE JSON in Spark
• In multi line JSON, we have to consider the whole file as an object where we have to parse to 
  find where the line ends

---------- Reading line delimited JSON -------------------
spark.read.format("json")\
                  .option("inferschema","true")\
                  .option("mode","PERMISSIVE")\
                  .load("/FileStore/tables/line_delimited_json.json").show()

---------- Reading multiline JSON -------------------
spark.read.format("json")\
                  .option("inferschema","true")\
                  .option("mode","PERMISSIVE")\
                  .option("multiline","true")\    # Neeed to enable multiline option
                  .load("/FileStore/tables/multiline_correct.json").show()
