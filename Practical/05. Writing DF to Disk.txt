Potential Interview Questions:
1. What are the modes available in DF writer?
2. What is partitionBy and bucketBy?
3. How to write data into multiple partitions?

General Structure of DF Writer API:

DataFrameWriter.format()\
               .option()\
               .partitionBy()\
               .bucketBy()\
               .save()

Example: df.write.format("CSV")\
           .option("header","true")\
           .option("mode","overwrite")\
           .option("path",".....")\            # path can be given in either option or save
           .save()

• Modes:
1. Append -> If we write a new file and older file already exists, it will append the new file
2. Overwrite -> If old file exists and we try to write a new file, older file will be deleted and new file is written
3. errorIfExists -> if file is there, throw error
4. Ignore -> it ignores the write if file exists in path

• Partitioning a file while writing to a disk
df.repartition(k)write.format("CSV")\       # repartition the single file in k files
        .option("header","true")\
        .option("mode","overwrite")\
        .option("path",".....")\            
        .save()
